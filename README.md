# CFD
This repository consists of CFD projects I used to develop my understanding of the field. Most of the work is done in Jupyter notebooks to make it easy to understand and follow along. These notebooks were wirtten for my understanding, but could be helpful to anyone interested in CFD. The projects come from John D. Anderson's book, *Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications*. These projects focus on the physical description and numerical methods used to solve the problems. As a mechanical/aerospace engineer, my code is by no means the most elegant way to solve these problems.
