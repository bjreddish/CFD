# Couette Flow of Incompressible Flow
The following notebooks cover two different methods for solving Couette flow: pressure correction and the Crank-Nicolson method. 


The Crank-Nicolson method is an implicit mehtod that utilizes the Thomas algorithm to solve for the flow.

The pressure correction mehtod is an explicit method that models the flow using a finite 2D space with a staggered grid.
