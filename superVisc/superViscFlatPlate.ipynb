    "# Supersonic Flow Over a Flat Plate: Full Navier-Stokes Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This example looks at a viscous supersonic flow over a flat plate using the MacCormack's technique. This example is provided by chapter 10 of John D. Anderson's book *Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Physical Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our flow will pass over a sharp flat plate with no angle of attack. This plate will be of length $L$ and a laminar boundary layer will form at the beginning of the plate and remain laminar for the remainder of the length. Due to this boundary layer, the flow senses a curvature that generates a curved shock wave starting at the leading edge. The space between the plate and the shock wave is called the *shock layer*. This problem may be simple, but the results can provide insight into the complex phenomenon that occur in the shock layer along with the boundary layer. \n",
